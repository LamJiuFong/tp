## Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide (UG) of **EZContact**

&emsp;&emsp;In the dynamic and ever-evolving world of insurance, staying connected and organized is paramount.
Meet EzContact, your go-to solution designed exclusively for insurance agents. Navigating the complex network of clients,
policies, and leads has never been easier. EzContact empowers you to manage your contacts, streamline communication,

*  Seamlessly organize your clients' details, policy information, and communication history.
*  Stay on top of their leads, and convert potential clients into loyal customers.
*  Schedule appointments and follow-ups without missing a beat.

&emsp;&emsp;If you are a fast typist, EzContact is the perfect tool for you to keep track of all your customer
, it is faster than any other traditional GUI-based application available in the market! Remember, Time is Money ! The
faster you approach your customer, the more deal you seal.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `name` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/<name> [a/<address>]` can be used as `n/John Doe a/Kent Ridge` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/<tag>]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/<name> p/<phone number>`, `p/12341234 n/John` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* For `tag` and `insurance`, only one of the customer's `tag`/`insurance` must contain keywords as a prefix. </br>

## Advanced Features

### Managing data

EzContact's data is stored as a json file at : `<JAR file directory>/data/addressbook.json`, where `<JAR file directory>`
is the directory you placed our `EzContact.jar` file.

**Saving data:**

EzContact's data is saved automaticaly whenever a command that changes the data is executed.

**Editing the data file:**

Advanced users are welcomed to update the data stored in EzContact directly by editing the `addressbook.json` file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If the format of the file becomes invalid after an edit, EzContact will launch with an empty data file, and will
overwrite the whole data file after a command that changes the data file is executed. Hence, users are **strongly
recommended to store a backup** of the data file before editing it.

</box>

**Storing/Restoring backup data files:**

Users can store a backup of the current data file by simply creating a copy of the `addressbook.json` file.
To restore a previously backed-up file, simply place the json file in the `<JAR file directory>/data` directory
and rename the file to `addressbook.json`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q:** Can I transfer my data to another computer? <br>
**A:** Yes, you can. Install EzContact in the computer and replace the `addressbook.json` file in the `<JAR file directory>/data` directory
with the `addressbook.js` file from your previous computer. <br> <br>
**Q:** Why are there sample customers when I first launch EzContact and how do I get rid of them? <br>
**A:** The sample customers are for new users to try out various commands in EzContact. To get rid of them, simply type `clear` in the
command box.
